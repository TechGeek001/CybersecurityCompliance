# Lab 1: Behavioral Data Analysis for Cybersecurity Compliance
In this lab, your team will conduct a behavioral data analysis study to explore how employee behavior impacts
cybersecurity compliance at a fictitious company, TechSafe Solutions. Using concepts from Session 6 (e.g., behavioral
theories, data collection, statistical analysis), you'll analyze survey data from Employee_Survey_Results.xlsx, focusing
on correlations between variables, build a simple theory, and present findings on what drives or hinders compliance.
